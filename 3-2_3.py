# When we have structured data, it is often categorical, meaning
# a series of discrete values, often strings or ID numbers, that
# are not intended to be interpreted mathematically -- things
# as simple as category labels, states, country names -- or
# a numerical example -- postal codes are actually categorical

# In order to get this kind of data ready for machine learning, 
# we need to encode it properly -- which leads us to 
# one hot encoding
# this is a method where each category is represented 
# in a dataset as a single dimension, 
# encoded 0 or 1 indicating if that category is set

# There are naturally a lot of ways to write the code to turn a
# categorical variable into a one hot encoded tensor -- 
# one interesting idea is to use an identity matrix
# assuming you have three discreet values A, B, C, 
# represent those
# as a list ['A', 'B', 'C'], and then A is 0, B is 1, C is 2 as
# ordinal index values -- we can use an identity matrix to turn
# the ordinal into a one hot encoded representation

# let's start off creating a simple network, we'll make the
# input and output dimensions variable, and introduce a new
# activation -- Softmax -- this is a function that smooths out
# values to get the total of all possibilities to sum to 1
# you may recognize this as a probability -- that's the effect
# you can take classifier results and nudge them into probability
# classes, which is very useful with a binary classifier trying
# to distinguish one thing from another

# a new loss function -- cross entropy -- makes a debut, 
# which is # very useful for classifiers, 
# it differs from mean squared error
# in that it is less concerned about the actual value 
# in a prediction
# than it is in which prediction has the largest value -- 
# the idea here
# is that for a binary classifier, the answer with the highest 
# probability is 'the' prediction, even though it may not be 100%
